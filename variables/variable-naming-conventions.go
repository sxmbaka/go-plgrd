package variables

/*
Below are naming conventions for variables and constant in golang

1. A variable or constant name can only start with a letter or an underscore.
2. It can be followed by any number of letters, numbers or underscores after that
3. Go is case sensitive so uppercase and lowercase letters are treated differently.
4. The variable or constant name cannot be any keyword name in Go
5. There is no limit on the length of variable or constant name. But is advisable to have the variable name of optimum length.
6. Finally, the convention in Go is to use MixedCaps or mixedCaps rather than underscores to write multiword names.
